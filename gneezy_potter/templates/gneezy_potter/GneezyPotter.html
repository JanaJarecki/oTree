  <p>
  Next is an investment task. The task has 9 rounds. For each round you will receive 100 cents cents. You decide which part of the 100 cents (between 0 cents and 100 cents) you wish to keep and which part you wish invest in a lottery like the following:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    You have a chance of 2/3 (67%) to lose the amount you invested and<br> a chance of 1/3 (33%) to win two and a half times (2.5) the amount you invested.
  </blockquote> 

  <p>
    Suppose you decide to invest X cents (0 &le; X &le; 100) in the lottery. You are asked to enter the amount into the form below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your earnings are determined as follows. Say you invested an amount of X in the lottery:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>With probability 67% the lottery pays zero and you earn the amount that was not invested.
    <li>With probability 33% the lottery pays 2.5X and your earn +2.5X plus the amount that was not invested.
  </ul>

  <h2>Investment Decision</h2>
  Which part of the 100 cents do you wish to invest in the lottery stated above?
